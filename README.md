Source To Image Nginx
=====================

This repository contains the source for creating a
[source-to-image](https://github.com/openshift/source-to-image) builder image,
which can be used to create reproducible Docker images from your static directory's
source code served by nginx. The resulting image can be run using [Docker](https://docker.com).

For more information about using these images with OpenShift, please see the official
[OpenShift Documentation](https://docs.openshift.org/latest/using_images/s2i_images/php.html).
